# StepBar

This component will be used to render a progress indicator and a title corresponding to the current `step`. The progress percentage corresponds to the current `step` / `titles.length`. All additional props passed to the `<StepBar />` will be applied to the `<ProgressBar />` component contained therein.

## Usage Example

```JSX
<StepBar
    step={this.props.step}
    titles={[
    	'You can pass Text',
    	(<IconGroupLink type="check">Or Components</IconGroupLink>),
    ]}
/>
```
