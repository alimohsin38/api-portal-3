# Timer

The timer is used to count down, in seconds, between a time passed in and an end time. 

Current Time must be passed in to avoid corrupted local time. 

This component will display time in a `DD:HH:mm:ss` format. Days or hours will be removed if they are 0, however the minutes will remain if they are 0. 

ie: 
If the time left is 1 day 0 hours, you will have a time of `1:00:00`
If the time left is 1 hours 0 minutes, you will have a time of `01:00:00`
If the time left is 1 second, you will have the time of `00:01`

It will also support the passing of the `oneHour` prop, to limit it's time display to only an hour and if the endTim is further in the future it will not start counting down until it reaches 1 hour. 

Seconds will be trimmed off if the timer reaches a day or more. 

ie:
If the time left is 1 day 2 hours, passing in the `oneHour` prop, it will display a time of `59:59`

Note: This component uses the [Indicator](https://github.com/abcfinancial2/protonpack/blob/master/src/components/indicator/indicator.md) component from [ProtonPack](https://github.com/abcfinancial2/protonpack) and will pass it's danger or warning state down as styleType.

## Usage Example

```JSX 
 <Timer currentTime="2017-09-15T15:53:00" endTime="2017-09-19T15:53:00" oneHour />
```

* endTime
* oneHour
* lastHour
* icon
* iconClass
* onTick
* onHide
* warning
* danger

### `currentTime`
* **required**

Will be triggered every second, regardless of warning or danger conditions.

### `onHide`

Callback for hide events. 

In combination with `lastHourOnly`, will be triggered when timer crosses the hide threshold or if timer starts outside of the hide threshold.

### `warning`
* *optional*
* type: object shape
    * time
        * type: number
    * callback
        * type: func


An object with a predefined shape of `time` and a `callback`. 

`time` must numeric value in seconds of when the `callback` is triggered and every second henceforth, or until the danger condition is met.

### `danger`
* *optional*
* type: object shape
    * time
        * type: number
    * callback
        * type: func


An object with a predefined shape of `time` and a `callback`.
