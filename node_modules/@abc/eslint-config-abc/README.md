# Frontend Configurations

This library contains all of the common configurations used in Frontend Applications at ABC, but is also built to be deployed as an NPM repository.

To use the ESLint Extends features, the package must be named eslint-config-\*. This is why the library is named eslint-config-abc, instead of a more generic name. But it **should** contain all the frontend configurations for ABC 3.0 applications.

Settings in this Repo:

* .eslint
* .gitignore
* .stylelintrc
* .babelrc

## ESLint Config

To use this, copy the `.eslintrc` file to your project, then install the npm repository:

    npm install --save-dev @abc/eslint-config-abc

The configuration is pulled in through the `extends` attribute. 

The contained .eslintrc file is meant to serve as a template. 

## Blurb about multiple config addition

The base config used by extending `@abc/eslint-config-abc` gives basic rules to be adhered to 
in all javascript code. If writing frontend code that uses React you can extend `@abc/esling-config-abc/react` instead.
This will provide more rules that are specific to writing components in React.

#### Globals

### ESLint in IntelliJ

ESLint takes some setup to get working in IntelliJ. This is how I was able to get it to work, if you find a better way to do these things in the future then please update this document. 

1. Install the dependencies globally.

    `npm install -g eslint eslint-plugin-react @abc/eslint-config-abc`

2. Go to `Preferences -> Languages & Frameworks -> JavaScript -> Code Quality Tools -> ESLint`

  * Click Enable.  
  * Select your Node Interpreter. (where Node is installed usually in your root ~/ folder) 
  * ESLint: Package In this field, specify the location of the eslint package installed in the current project.
  * Check the setting `ESLint config file path: * Let eslint search for .eslintrc up the folder tree`

3. Then to turn off IntelliJ checking for semicolons regardless of ESLint, go to `Preferences -> Editor -> Inspections -> JavaScript -> Code style issues -> Unterminated statement` and **disable** inpsection. 

Then it *should* work correctly. The errors are not very prominent, but they are there. 

I also found that going to `Preferences -> Editor -> Inspections -> JavaScript -> Code quality tools` then unchecking the ESlint checkboxes there didn't effect my reporting. Not sure if this helps, but it might cause issues somewhere. 

#### Rules

Most of the rules will warn instead of erroring to ease development, but will still annoy the developer of the errors.

* `"quotes": ["error", "single"]` - single quotes always (except for json files 😖)
* `"semi": ["error", "never"]` - death to semi colons!
* `"no-unexpected-multiline": "error"` - fixes some semi-colonless issues
* `"indent": ["warn", 2]` - 2 spaces make code much easier to read on contstrainted windows (like github) and are easy to get used to
* `"object-curly-spacing": ["warn", "never"]` - Don't put a space after curly brackets. eg: `{ bad: '👎' }` `{good: '👍'}`
* `"array-bracket-spacing": ["warn", "never"]` - same as above, but with arrays
* `"no-unused-vars": "warn"` - sometimes it happens... please don't make me not be able to compile
* `"keyword-spacing": ["error", { "before": true, "after": true}]` - there must be spaces after keywords. eg: `if(bad)` `if (good)`, same for `for`, `do`, and other keywords
* `"eqeqeq": ["error","smart"]` - Force the use of `===` instead of `==`

## Markdown Linter

Recommended to install into the user root directory on your machine.

ie: the `~/.mdlrc` folder on Mac and Linux.

    rules "~MD001", // Do Not increment header levels by 1
          "~MD013"  // Do not restrict line length to 80 characters
