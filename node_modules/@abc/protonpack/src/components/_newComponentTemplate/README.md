# NewComponentTemplate

Here you can briefly describe your new component, what purpose it serves, what it does, any kind of nuanced functionality. Or feel free to omit the description entirely if you're component is incredibly simple and straightforward.

In the *Required?* field, please pick yes or no. Both is never an option.

**Your** component needs to be exported in the file `./src/export.js`, as well as your example to the `./src/examples/KitchenSink.js` file.

This is by no means a document that must be followed exactly. Only the format is required. Some components will need to add more information or remove some information, but all should follow this format.

## Usage Example

```JSX
<NewComponentTemplate>... content ...</NewComponentTemplate>
```

---

## Props:

* [someProp](#someprop)
* [someOtherProp](#someotherprop)

### someProp

| Required? | Type | Default | Options |
|:---:|:---:|---|---|
| no | any | `'xyz'` | `['lg', 'sm', 'etc']` |

Some description of someProp here. Can be anything you'd like.

The "default" field is for components who have default options. Not all components will need this. Please remove it if your's does not.

The "options" field is optional for components who have a static number of input values. Not all components will need this. Please remove it if your's does not.

Object structure:

```
{
  fieldOne: 'one field to rule them all',
  lasty: 'Go Lasty!'
}
```

#### fieldOne

| Required? | Type | Default | Options |
|:---:|:---:|---|---|

This is an example of a generic prop.
